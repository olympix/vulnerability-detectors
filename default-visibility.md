## State variable declaration or function definition without specifying visibility 

* Vulnerability ID: ```solidity-default-visibility```
* Severity: Low
* Confidence: High
* Difficulty: Easy
* Versions affected: All

## Historical Exploit
The Parity MultiSig Wallet hack occured as a result of developers leaving two functions public, 
which allowed the attacker to change the ownership of the contract to their attacking contract address,
and ultimately steal $31M worth of ETH.

## Detection rule: 
Flag if a state variable is declared without specifying a visibility, or if a function is defined without specifying a visibility.

## Vulnerable Example
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Mint {
    
    address owner;

    function doSomething() {
    }

}
```

### Why is this a problem?
Labelling the visibility explictly makes it easier to spot incorrect assumptions about who can access a particular variable or function.

## Corrected Example 
#### Intead, specify the state variable as public, private, or internal. Specify functions as public, external, private, or internal. The principle of least privellege should be followed -- external and public visibilities should be used with caution. 
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Mint {
    address private owner;

    function doSomething() private {
    }
}
```
