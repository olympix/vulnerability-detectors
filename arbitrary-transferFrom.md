## `msg.sender` not used in `transferFrom`

* Vulnerability ID: ```arbitrary-transferFrom```
* Severity: High
* Confidence: High
* Difficulty: Easy
* Versions affected: All

## Detection rule: 
Flag if `msg.sender` is not used as `from` in `transferFrom`.

## Historic Exploit: 

## Vulnerable Example
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract vulnerable {
        function a(address from, address to, uint256 amount) public {
        erc20.transferFrom(from, to, am);
    }
}
```

### Why is this a problem?
If someone approves the contract `bad`, another person can interact with the contract by invoking `transferFrom` and providing the source address of the approver. This allows them to transfer the tokens from the approver's address to their own.

## Corrected Example 
#### Instead, always use `msg.sender`  as `from` in `transferFrom`.
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract invulnerable {
        function a(address to, uint256 amount) public {
        erc20.transferFrom(msg.sender, to, am);
    }
}
```
