## Array length assigned

* Vulnerability ID: ```array-length-assignment```
* Severity: High
* Confidence: Medium
* Difficulty: Easy
* Versions affected: `solc 0.4.x-0.5.x`

## Detection rule: 
Flag if an array's length is being set.

## Historic Exploit: 

## Vulnerable Example
A.sol : 
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense
pragma solidity ^0.4.0;

contract C {
    uint[] arr;
    function f(int a) internal returns (uint a) {
        arr.length = a;
    }
}
```


### Why is this a problem?
Storage or state variables in a contract are identified by a 256-bit integer. By setting the length of the array to 2**256-1, a user can index all available storage slots. Therefore, a potential attacker could still gain control over the storage. In general, it's bad to set array length(even by the programmer). Up till `solc 0.5.x`, `length` was not a readonly parameter.
