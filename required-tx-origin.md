## `tx.origin` used in `require()`

* Vulnerability ID: ```required-tx-origin```
* Severity: Medium
* Confidence: Medium
* Difficulty: Easy
* Versions affected: All

## Detection rule:
Flag if `tx.origin` is used inside of a `require()` statement.

## Historic Exploit:

## Vulnerable Example
```solidity
contract TxOrigin {
    address owner = msg.sender;

    function bug() {
        require(tx.origin == owner);
        // additional code
    }
}
```

#### Why is this a problem?
If the address defined to be the owner of the `TxOrigin` contract calls another contract which subsequently calls function `bug()` in the `TXOrigin` contract, the `require` condition will be met, though this is likely unintended behavior, and could result in an exploit depending on what function `bug()` does.

## Corrected Example
#### Instead, check an alternative condition that matches desired semantics such as `msg.sender`.
```solidity
contract TxOrigin {
    address owner = msg.sender;

    function fixed() {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        // additional code
    }
}
```
